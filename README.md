  Inspired by http://todotxt.com/ by Gina Trapani, however I wanted to make something that syncs with Dropbox and written in Ruby for easy extensibility.

Goals
=====

  - Ruby client for Linux, OS X and Windows.
  - Full Dropbox synchronization with offline access.
  - iOS (iPad and iPhone) and Android app for access everywhere.
