todo
====

  Inspired by http://todotxt.com/ by Gina Trapani, however I wanted to make something that syncs with Dropbox and written in Ruby for easy extensibility.

Goals
=====

  - Ruby client for Linux, OS X and Windows.
  - Full Dropbox synchronization with offline access.
  - iOS (iPad and iPhone) and Android app for access everywhere.

Usage
=====

  - Place a `.todo_config.json` in your home folder (i.e.`~/.todo_config.json` or `C:\Users\basicxman\.todo_config.json`)
  - Run commands in a shell
    - `todo help`
    - `todo history`
    - `todo history 20`
    - `todo sync`
